What is on-prem?

"On-premises" (often spelled "on-premises" or "on-premise") refers to the traditional 
computing model where an organization owns, operates, and manages its own physical data centers, servers, and IT infrastructure within its own premises or facilities. In this model, all hardware, software, networking, 
and data storage are physically located on the organization's property.

On premises infrastructure 

-physical hardwares

-data centres 

-complete control 

What are the 4 types of cloud?

1) Public cloud- cloud resources and services owned by 
a third party cloud provider
2) Private cloud- Private cloud is dedicated to a single organisation.
3) Hybrid cloud- is a combination of both public and private clouds
allowing data and applications to be shared between them 
4) Multi-Cloud- strategy involves using multiple cloud service providers to meet different business needs 

What are the different types of cloud services?

1) Infrastructure as a Service- provides virtualised computing resources over the internet 

2) Platform as a Service - provides a platform and enviroment for developing, deploying and managing applications 

3) Function as a Service- allows developers to run code in response to events or triggers without provisioning or managing servers

4) Container as a service- provides a platform for deploying and managing containers/ usually using tools like Kubernetes

5) Database as a service- offers managed database services allowing users to create, operate and scale databases without the burden of database admin 

6) Storage as a Service- provide scaleable and cost effective cloud based storage solutions for data storage, back up and Archiving 

**Advantages of cloud computing:**

1)Cost savings- Cloud services eliminate the need for organisations to invest in and maintain expensive on-premise hardware and data centres 

2)Scalability and flexibility- you can easily scale up or down/ Global reach- cloud providers have data centres in multiple regions- reach people all over the world 

3)Accesibility- cloud services can be accessed over the internet in any part of the world 
4) Speed and agility 
5) Reliability and Availability 
6) Security and compliance 
7) Disaster recovery


**Disadvantages of cloud computing** 

1)Security and privacy concerns 

2)Cost management 

3)limited customisation

4)dependency on service providers 

5)data transfer and Bandwidth cost 

**What is Capex ?**

Capital expenditures- refers to significant investments 
that a company makes in assets or projects with the expectation of deriving
long term benefits or values 

The main purpose of expenditure are made to aquire upgrade expand maintain assets that are essential 
for the companys operations and growth


**What is Operational expenditures?**

are ongoing day to day expenses incurred by a business to maintain its regular operations and generate revenue 

They are both a financial strategy 


**Three largest cloud providers:**

**AWS-**
- early markert entry 
- global reach 
- extensive service portfolio 

**Microsoft Azure-**

-Integration with microsoft products 

-Hybrid cloud solutions 

-Enterprise focus 

**Google Cloud Platform**

-Data and analytics strengths 

-Global network 

-Cloud native focus 

**What are the 4 pillars of DevOps?**

**How do they link into the Cloud do you think?**

1) Culture- Devops culture encourages cross functional teams to work seamlessly across development, operations
and other disciplines 
2) Automation- Cloud providers offer tools and sevrices that facilitate automation, making it easier 
to provision and manage cloud resources programically 
3) Lean- Cloud resources are scaleable and can be provisioned on-demand 
4) Measurement- Cloud platforms offer built in monitoring and analytics    kkkservices making it easier to measure the performance of application infrstructure.
